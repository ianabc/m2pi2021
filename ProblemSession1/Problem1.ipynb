The first field represents the minimum and maximum number of occurrences of that character which are needed to satisfy our policy. For example, the first line says that the password is `asjuaycbnwo` and that we expect to find between 1 and 9 (inclusive) occurrences of the letter `a` in that password. Given those rules we have\n",
